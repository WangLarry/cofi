`string` - A unique identifier of the form in the page. 
A page can contain more than 1 form, and supplying meaningful id helps with log messages (since all forms log messages
are written in the same place - console). 

In case id was not supplied, a default formatted id will be added (such as 'form-1', 'form-2', etc).

Example:
```
const model = {
  id: “employee”
  // ...
};
```
