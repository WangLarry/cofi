  <Styled.P>In this demo, we calculate actions duration of the entire end-to-end handle - the react side as well as the
    base Form class calculations (as suppose to the console debug messages which shows the actions duration only of the 
    Form class part).
  </Styled.P>
  <Styled.P>Actions duration is a direct result of:</Styled.P>
  <Styled.Text>
    <ul>
      <li>Form's internal state updates number</li>
      <li>Number of fields which evaluated in the specific action
        (such as init evaluates all fields as suppose to changeValue that evaluates only the specific field and its
          dependencies)</li>
      <li>Handler's duration (such as specific validator / stateChange / more handlers can take some time,
        especially if they are async functions)</li>
      <li>For changeValue and changeState actions there is additional minimum 250ms debounce time</li>
    </ul>
  </Styled.Text>
